## Introduction
Leaderboards.gg (lbgg) was sparked by the purchase of speedrun.com by the esports data analytics company Elo Entertainment.

In lbgg we see an opportunity to help the "Online and competitive retro gaming" (basically speedruns and scoreruns) community continue to grow and thrive with tools (a centralized website and database, an API, a smaller site for clear documentation) built to scale, on modern technologies, curated to what its users want, without it being monetized. Because its open source, the community owns it and can use it as they wish.

Because it is currently under construction (and in two separate repos), we are using this repo to represent the project as a whole.
